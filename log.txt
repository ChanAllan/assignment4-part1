Tasks: Corrected the remaining errors in multtable.php. The multtable.php works with values passed via GET method. style.css contains adding borders to the multiplication table. I also reviewed some resources during this time.

Tasks: Corrected all remaining errors in the assignment which was not shown on local server, but was shown on the live server (html_public). login.php now works with content1.php and content2.php for displaying the correct values. Logging out and clearing sessions now works. multtable.php and loopback.php works as expected.
